Usage: np notify [options...]

Show notifications when the track changes, playback is started/stopped or the queue is empty.

Options:
  --is-running      Check if the daemon process has already started.
                    Exits with '0' if it has, '1' otherwise.

  --stop            Stop notification daemon execution.
                    Can be used during system shutdown,
                    but isn't part of everyday usage.

Examples:
  # Start the notification daemon, let it run in the background.
  # Should be done at user login.
  np notify --is-running || ( np notify & )
