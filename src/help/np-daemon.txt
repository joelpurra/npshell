Usage: np daemon [options...]

Play sounds in queue as soon as there are any.
Can be controlled with 'np start' and 'np stop',
as well as the rest of the queue commands.

Options:
  --is-running      Check if the daemon process has already started.
                    Exits with '0' if it has, '1' otherwise.

  --stop            Stop daemon execution. Can be used during system
                    shutdown, but isn't part of everyday usage.

  --verbose         Output paths to the sounds as they play.

Examples:
  # Start the daemon, let it run in the background.
  # Should be done at user login.
  np daemon --is-running || ( np daemon & )
